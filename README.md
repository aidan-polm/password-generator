# Small Python Projects

## Password Generator
> This short project was created to test my skills in Python. When you run it, it will ask you how many characters you would like the password to be (first letters, then numbers, then symbols). It will then output a suggested password with your specified requirements.


## Blackjack
> This fun project challenges users to go against a pseudo-random number generator. Standard blackjack rules apply, where users must get closest to 21 without going over. The script (dealer) is attempting to do the same.


## Rock, Paper, Scissors
> Another 'challenge the computer' project, where users are asked to choose rock, paper, or scissors. The script then does the same, compares each choice, and outputs the winner.
